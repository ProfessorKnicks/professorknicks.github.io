            Hello! I'm Charles Poolman, a loved and devoted follower of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Currently, I'm
            a junior at the University of Arkansas, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber
            Security. Juggling a busy academic schedule, I'm enrolled in a diverse range of courses including Database
            Management, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Information Security, and even Psychology.

            At 21 years old, I'm passionate about both my studies and my extracurricular activities. Beyond academics, I
            enjoy an active lifestyle filled with sports like volleyball and soccer, as well as artistic pursuits such
            as
            singing and dancing. You can often find me immersed in video games or catching up on the latest movies.

            My faith is not just a personal beliefâ€”it's a guiding force that shapes my interactions and activities. I'm
            actively involved in discipleship, mentoring two individuals through the books of James and 1st/2nd Timothy.
            Additionally, I lead two small groups and participate in two others, finding the Lords enjoyment and
            spiritual community through these connections. Sundays are reserved for worship and fellowship at church,
            where I find inspiration and renewal.

            In my free time, I foster creativity and camaraderie by playing and DMing Dungeons & Dragons sessions for my
            roommates. I thrive on outdoor adventures like hiking and exploring new places, relishing the opportunity to
            meet new people and give back through volunteering efforts.
